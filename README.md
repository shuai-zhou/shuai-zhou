### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a trained demographer and rural sociologist who also has expertise in geospatial analytics. My research interests include planned relocation, environmental migration, and computational and spatial analysis of big data using open source solutions on High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms.
